# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: Drag & Drop Deployment (Easiest)

1. **Prepare files**: Your project is ready with these key files:
   - `index.html` (main page)
   - `script.js` (JavaScript functionality)
   - `netlify.toml` (configuration)
   - `_redirects` (routing)

2. **Visit Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login with GitHub, GitLab, or email

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
   - Drag the entire project folder to the deployment area
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Your site will be live with a random URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

### Option 2: Netlify CLI (Advanced)

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login**:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Deploy from project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\shiva\OneDrive\Documents\Desktop\ML\Fake news Detection"
   netlify deploy --prod --dir .
   ```

### Option 3: Git Repository Deployment

1. **Create GitHub repository**
2. **Upload project files**
3. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - In Netlify dashboard: "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Build settings: Leave empty (static site)
   - Publish directory: `/` (root)

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

Your project includes:

- ✅ `index.html` - Beautiful responsive web interface
- ✅ `script.js` - AI-powered fake news detection logic
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration (updated to skip Python deps)
- ✅ `_redirects` - URL routing
- ✅ `package.json` - Identifies this as a static site
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes Python files (requirements.txt, etc.)

## ⚠️ Important Note

This is a **static HTML/JavaScript website** that doesn't need Python. The `requirements.txt` file is excluded from deployment to prevent Netlify from trying to install Python dependencies.

## 🎯 What Your Deployed Site Will Have

### Features:
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant fake news detection
- **Multiple AI Models**: Choose from 4 different algorithms
- **Sample Articles**: Quick testing with pre-loaded examples
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Interactive UI**: Beautiful animations and feedback
- **Confidence Scores**: Detailed probability analysis

### Sample URL Structure:
- Main page: `https://your-site.netlify.app/`
- All routes redirect to main page (SPA behavior)

## 🔧 Customization After Deployment

1. **Custom Domain**: 
   - In Netlify dashboard → Domain settings
